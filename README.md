# Code Test Java
#### Task: To creating a simple back-end for an online marketplace

This repository can be used to create a simple back-end for an online marketplace. Coded in Java, using Spring and SQL for persistent storage. Does not implement Swagger.

## Getting Started
### Installation

#### IntelliJ

Install the following packages to ensure the code compiles (these may be installed automatically when opened in IntelliJ):

1. Spring Boot DevTools
2. Spring Data JPA
3. Spring Web
4. PostgreSQL Driver
5. Rest Repositories
6. Spring HATEOAS

## Run Build

Build and run and a browser window should open automatically to ```https://localhost:[port]/product``` and show all products stored. 

Visiting ```https://localhost:[port]/swagger/index.html``` will provide you with a list of endroutes.

## Future Developments

- Currently, each product has an id which is autogenerated, but also has a product code which is manually set. Depending on use case, product code could be removed if each individual item were to have a unique product code (the generated id from the database would then act as the product code). 
- Implement Swagger.
